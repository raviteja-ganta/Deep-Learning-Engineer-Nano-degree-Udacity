This repo contains all project files which are implemented as part of Deep Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity in colloboration with AWS and Facebook AI

## Contents:

* [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis model](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Deploying%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20model)

* [Dog breed classifier using CNN's](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Dog%20breed%20classifier%20using%20CNN's) - Goal of this project is to use CNN to classify an image in to 133 breeds of dogs. My code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

  Main steps involved are:
  1) Detect Humans
  2) Detect Dogs
  3) Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds from scratch
  4) Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds(using Transfer Learning)
  5) Write final algorithm

* [Face generation using GAN's](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Face%20generation%20using%20GAN's) - Goal is to define and train DCGAN network on dataset of faces and finally to get our network generate new faces that look as realistic as possible.

  Main steps involved are:
  1) Define Discriminator network
  2) Define Generator network
  3) Initialize weights of above networks
  4) Build complete network using both discriminator and generator networks
  5) Calculate discriminator and generator losses
  6) Training the network

* [Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Generate%20TV%20Scripts) - Goal is to generate Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. Neural network will generate a new, fake TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

Main steps involved are:
1) Data Pre-processing and creating dataloader
2) Build Neural network
3) Define forward and backpropagation
4) Selecting best hyperparameters
5) Neural network training
6) Generate TV Script 

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Predicting%20Bike-Sharing%20Patterns) -
