## Contents:

* [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis model](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Deploying%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20model)

* [Dog breed classifier using CNN's](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Dog%20breed%20classifier%20using%20CNN's) - Goal of this project is to use CNN to classify an image in to 133 breeds of dogs. My code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

* [Face generation using GAN's](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Face%20generation%20using%20GAN's)

* [Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Generate%20TV%20Scripts)

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Engineer-Nano-degree-Udacity/tree/master/Predicting%20Bike-Sharing%20Patterns)
